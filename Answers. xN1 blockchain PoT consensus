Proof-of-Transcendence consensus, created by Professor N1KURA on the xN1 blockchain, is one of the most advanced and secure security methods used in the blockchain. It includes a number of security mechanisms, such as a mechanism for detecting deviations in the operation of network nodes, a decentralized system for identifying and confirming the identity of network participants, protection against majority attacks, and the use of strong encryption and hashing algorithms. All of these mechanisms work together to ensure the highest level of security on the xN1 blockchain and protect it from external attacks and manipulation.
