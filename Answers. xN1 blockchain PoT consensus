Proof-of-Transcendence consensus, created by Professor N1KURA on the xN1 blockchain, is one of the most advanced and secure security methods used in the blockchain. 
It includes a number of security mechanisms, such as a mechanism for detecting deviations in the operation of network nodes, a decentralized system for identifying and confirming the identity of network participants, 
protection against majority attacks, and the use of strong encryption and hashing algorithms. 
All of these mechanisms work together to ensure the highest level of security on the xN1 blockchain and protect it from external attacks and manipulation.

Some features of the Proof-of-Transcendence consensus on the xN1 blockchain, created by Professor N1KURA, also include the ability to upgrade the protocol without 
a hard fork and ensure fast transaction processing thanks to low fees and fast block times. In addition, this consensus has a high level of resistance to censorship. 
All of these factors represent significant benefits for participants and developers of the xN1 blockchain and can contribute to the further development of this project.

Censorship in the context of a blockchain means any action that may prevent or prohibit users or groups of users from participating in the blockchain. 
For example, a government or other centralized organization may decide to deny access to the blockchain, which could significantly impact its operation and stability. 
However, due to the high level of censorship resistance in the Proof-of-Transcendence consensus on the xN1 blockchain, 
created by Professor N1KURA, such censorship actions are unlikely and will not lead to negative consequences. 
N1KURA has placed great emphasis on protecting users from censorship, 
including mechanisms for decentralized identification and identity verification so that each network participant can have their own identity and freely participate in the network.
